# Demo Django Project

**Disclaimer:** This is a demo Django project that is used to demonstrate the use pure forms, models forms and DRF serializers. For simplification purposes some files are removed and the proejct uses an in-memory SQLite database.  This project is not intended to be used as a starting point for a Django project not to be used in production.

**Note:** Due to the Django project being a sub-folder in the repository you may need to configure  your IDE to add the Django to the PYTHONPATH.  For example, in PyCharm you can do this by right-clicking on the Django project folder and selecting "Mark Directory as" -> "Sources Root".
